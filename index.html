  <h1>Livingroom Renovation</h1>

    Decidedly less exciting, but it was a total blank canvas. It seemed like the natural ‘foyer’ or ‘lobby’ so to speak — the perfect area for a comfortable living area at the entrance of the space. Now those of you who are super astute might have noticed that you are walking into the back of one of the hot pink chairs, but before you call the layout police on me I'll just let you in on the behind the scenes fact that the right chair normally lives in the corner with a side table/lamp. We moved it for the photo because it just looked SOOOO much better being symmetrical in the shot. But don’t worry, it fits just perfectly in the corner, indeed.

    The general design direction of the space was to be bright, happy, airy, fun, and young. Joy needed the space to function as a design studio, blog studio, photo studio, and meeting area for clients … which means it needed to be divided up, but left open. Broken up, but in a really open way with just implied separation of space.

    For this project I brought on a designated Sr. Designer Samantha Gluck who was responsible for SOOOOO much, and she did an incredible job (hire her!!!). After the first meeting where we hashed out all the needs, wants, and Joy’s general studio desires, she came back with this rendering:

    So we started with the Murphy sofa from Room and Board, which is pretty dope for the price, I have to say. They were smart and finally did a readymade sofa in a saturated color. Normally most big box stores' no-lead time sofas are in like a sophisticated tweed — something safe and pretty, and you have to wait for these custom colors, but not this time. And it’s shape is just so cute. It was our ‘jumping off point’ so to speak and helped start the color palette.
